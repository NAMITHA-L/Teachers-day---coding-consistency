âœ… Problem 1: Two Sum (Find indices of two numbers that add up to target):

Loop through the array with two nested for loops.

For every pair of indices i and j, check if nums[i] + nums[j] == target.

If a pair is found, return their indices in an array: return new int[] {i, j}.

If no such pair is found, return an empty array.

Time complexity is O(nÂ²) â€” brute-force but works correctly.

âœ… Problem 2: Count Numbers with Even Number of Digits:

Loop through each number in the input array.

Count how many digits the number has using either Math.log10(num) + 1 or by converting to a string.

If the digit count is even (i.e., divisible by 2), increment the counter.

After the loop, return the count of numbers that had even digits.

Time complexity is O(n) â€” efficient and simple.
