### DAY 1

âœ… Problem 1: Two Sum (Find indices of two numbers that add up to target):

Loop through the array with two nested for loops.

For every pair of indices i and j, check if nums[i] + nums[j] == target.

If a pair is found, return their indices in an array: return new int[] {i, j}.

If no such pair is found, return an empty array.

Time complexity is O(nÂ²) â€” brute-force but works correctly.

âœ… Problem 2: Count Numbers with Even Number of Digits:

Loop through each number in the input array.

Count how many digits the number has using either Math.log10(num) + 1 or by converting to a string.

If the digit count is even (i.e., divisible by 2), increment the counter.

After the loop, return the count of numbers that had even digits.

Time complexity is O(n) â€” efficient and simple.

DAY 02 :
1. FizzBuzz
   <img width="1919" height="870" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-26 210436" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/281d0abf-f55f-414a-979c-4c4b71873fa2" />

This is a classic number substitution problem:

It loops from 1 to n.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it adds "FizzBuzz" to the result list.

If divisible only by 3, it adds "Fizz".

If divisible only by 5, it adds "Buzz".

Otherwise, it just adds the number itself as a string.

The results are stored in a list and returned.

2. Check if Two Binary Trees are Same
   <img width="1919" height="862" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-26 222301" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab0696c7-4e2d-451a-9613-a90628c3695f" />

This function compares two binary trees recursively:

If both current nodes are null, it returns true (identical at this point).

If only one is null or their values donâ€™t match, it returns false.

It then recursively checks the left and right child nodes of both trees.

If all corresponding nodes match, the trees are considered the same.

3. Group Anagrams (Without HashMap)
   <img width="1919" height="870" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-26 222029" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2481399e-c217-474d-80e8-c2c78c58a2c9" />

This groups strings that are anagrams:

Each word is sorted alphabetically to form a key pattern.

A list seen stores these sorted patterns.

For each word, it checks if its sorted pattern already exists in seen.

If it does, the word is added to the existing group in the result list.

If not, a new group is started and added to the result.

This avoids using HashMaps and keeps the logic simple for beginners.

4. Remove Elements from Linked List
<img width="1919" height="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891575d9-8739-4764-8b1c-9247bcc45e78" />

This removes all nodes with a specific value from a linked list:

A dummy node is created at the beginning to simplify edge cases like deleting the head.

A pointer cur traverses the list.

If the next node's value matches the given value, it's skipped (cur.next = cur.next.next).

If not, it moves forward.

Finally, it returns dummy.next which points to the possibly new head of the list.

###DAY 03
1. Valid Palindrome
Problem:
Check if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Approach:

Use two pointers (start from beginning and last from end).

Skip non-alphanumeric characters.

Compare lowercase versions of characters.

If at any point they differ, return false.

If loop completes, return true.

Why it works:
Efficient two-pointer technique that avoids extra space and handles edge cases like symbols and spaces.

2. Invert Binary Tree
Problem:
Invert (mirror) a binary tree by swapping left and right child nodes recursively.

Approach:

Base case: if the root is null, return null.

Swap left and right children of the current node.

Recursively call the same function on left and right children.

Return the modified root.

Why it works:
Simple and elegant recursive approach that traverses the tree top-down and inverts each subtree.

3. Top K Frequent Elements
Problem:
Given an integer array, return the k most frequent elements.

Approach:

Count the frequency of each number using a dictionary hs.

Use another dictionary frq to map frequency to a list of elements with that frequency.

Loop from highest possible frequency down to 1.

Collect elements in order until k elements are gathered.

Why it works:
This approach groups elements by frequency and then picks from highest to lowest â€” efficiently bypasses the need for sorting the entire array.
